# Wormhole

You ever think, "Hey I wish this langugage had the capability of some other language I like?" Enter Wormhole.

## Motivation

During the [Advent of Code](https://http://adventofcode.com/) 2018, I found myself writing the same functions in Elixir that
I knew I had used in Clojure, F#, or some other language. In order to prevent myself from doing this in the future, I
decided that building a library to do house all of these helpful functions across languages that I either knew or
wanted to learn.

## Desired functions

These are the functions that I've used and that I'd like to have in multiple languages. Some of them are already implemented
in the language already, so I won't reimplement them. Each implementation will list the functions as implemented in the language,
as well as links to their documentation.

- `map`
- `filter`
- `reduce`
- `reduce_while`
- `chunk`
- `chunk_by`
- `juxt`
- `min_by`
- `max_by`
- `frequencies`
- `group_by`
- `scan`
- `inc`
- `dec`
- `zip` (for arbitrary # of sequences)

## Languages
